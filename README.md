A version control system is a tool that manages different versions of a source code. Git is an example of a VCS
Within a git repository, there are three main areas include a working directory, staging index and the repository

Running the git init command sets up all of the necessary files and directories that Git will use to keep track of everything. All of these files are stored in a directory called .git

Always run the git status command when returning to a project or repository

With the git add command, we can add files from working directory to staging index and using git commmit, take files from staging index and save them to repository

the .gitignore file is used to tell Git about the files that Git should not track. This file should be placed in the same directory that the .git directory is in.
